# Citibikes Group Project
PUI_HW3-3_ErwanLeCun.ipynb is an ipython notebook detailing the code for our project.
I wrote a lot of the code for the early version of the project, with a lot of input from Anita and Miyabi. 
I handled the data, plotted the graphs, and conducted the statistical tests. 
Generally, our workload was split pretty evenly between the three of us.

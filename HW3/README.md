# PUI_HW3-1_ErwanLeCun.ipynb:

Generates 100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) from each of 6 different distributions (600 samples in total), all with the same population mean. 

These distributions include a Normal, a Poisson, a Binomial, a Chi-Squared, a Gamma, and a Lognormal distribution.              

Plots the sample mean against the sample size N for each distribution.

Plots the distributions of all sample means together as a histrogram.

# PUI_HW3-2_ErwanLeCun.ipynb:

Conducts a Z test and Chi Square test on given data.

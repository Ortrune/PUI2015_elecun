good reviews, though a bit generous, addressing all the key points  10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

thick lines are not necessary and cause ambiguity when thy overlap

the datapoints are sparse: the plot could be compressed on the x axis and this would aid comparison

tick labels are on he small side, but not terribly small 

color blindness compliant


NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
================================

madinghehe
===========

typical plot in finance: complies to tufte's idea of small multiples
nice seaborn plot that conveys a lot of info at once.


x, y labels should be spelled out, not a variable name with an underscore

labels too small

the fit line cannot be seen over the points. consider a different color or remove the points inside the contours (which are redundant and blended anyways)




svarmit
========

the 3d as usual makes comparison difficult. additionally 3d bind distort the perception: we should compare differences in height but we are left with the impression given byt he difference in volumes

the color is redundant with the year 

tick labels too small

the cause of dheath axis labels are offset with respect to the variable

typo in the title (parenthesis close that was never open)



YiningFan
=========
units missing in labels

tick labels too small

lines unexplained

color indistinguishable for the 10% of the male population that is color blind
